In-built\r\n2. Custom\r\n\r\nBefore we see both of these types, let us first see the syntax. **Filters** are written in **view** in following manner:\r\n\r\n{{expression | filterName : param2 : param3 .... : param_N }}\r\n\r\nLet's see a demo given below:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\nEnter Amount: <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"data.amount\"><br/><br/>\r\n$ Format: {{ data.amount | currency : \"$\" }}<br/>\r\nUSD$ Format: {{ data.amount | currency : \"USD$\" }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above demo, we have used an in-built **filter** named as **currency**. This **filter** takes the symbol as its argument. So when we inout some amount in the text box, it shows the amount in a formatted manner with symbol of the currency appended to it.\r\n\r\nNow, let us make our own custom **filter**.\r\n\r\nWe had discussed a use case, where we might have to generate numbers between a particular range. This can be done using our own **custom filter**\r\n\r\nHere we go:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<label>Min Number</label> <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"data.min\"><br><br>\r\n<label>Max Number</label> <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"data.max\"><br><br>\r\n<label>Array of Numbers</label> {{ data.min | range:data.max }}<br><br>\r\n<label>List of Numbers</label>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li ng-repeat=\"n in data.min | range : data.max\">{{n}}</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<script type=\"application/javascript\">\r\n    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);\r\n    myApp.filter('range', function () {\r\n        return function (min, max) {\r\n            if (min > max || max === undefined) {\r\n                var temp = max;\r\n                max = min;\r\n                min = temp || 1;\r\n            }\r\n            min = parseInt(min);\r\n            max = parseInt(max);\r\n            var input = [];\r\n            for (var i = min; i <= max; i++) {\r\n                input.push(i);\r\n            }\r\n            return input;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's what code given above is doing:\r\n\r\n1. We have created two input boxes which take min and max number from the user.\r\n2. On the basis of min and max number entered by the user, a list displays all the numbers staring from min number to max number.\r\n\r\n![Filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NamitaMalik/Filters-in-AngularJS/master/Filters.png)\r\n\r\nNow, let's check how this **code** works:\r\n\r\n1. We take min and max input from user which defines our range.\r\n2. If you see the code given above, then you will notice that we have used a **filter** named as 'range' here.\r\n3. Now, let's see our **JavaScript** code. Here we have created a module and then using that module we have defined a **filter**. Inside the **filter** **function** we pass name of the **filter** as the argument and also define a **function** which returns another **function**.\r\n4. It is this returned **function** that actually does all the work and returns us the formatted result.\r\n5. This **function** which is returned, takes arguments in the following convention:\r\n\r\n  A. 1st argument --> Expression to the left of '|' where **'filter'** is declared on the view.\r\n\r\n  B. 2nd argument --> Expression to the right of the ':' where **'filter'** is declared on the view.\r\n\r\n  C. A **filter** can take 'n' number of arguments.\r\n\r\n6. For our **filter** 'range', we have taken only 2 arguments - min and max.\r\n7. To min, data.min is passed while max gets data.max.\r\n8. We have parsed the min and max passed to integers and then there is an input array to which all the numbers between min and max is passed.\r\n9. input array is being returned.\r\n10. On view, the entire expression inside {{}} is replaced by what is returned by our **filter** 'range', hence we get to see the array containing the numbers.\r\n11. In the rest of the code, we have also created a list of these numbers using a very powerful **AngularJS** directive **ng-repeat**.\r\n\r\nIn this blog we have seen some basic stuff related to **filters**, there are a hell lot of situations where **filters** can be used, you just need to identify those situations and use this ultra cool feature of **AngularJS**!\r\n\r\nFollow Me\r\n---\r\n[Github](https://github.com/NamitaMalik)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/namita13_04)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/namita-malik-a7885b23)\r\n\r\n[More Blogs By Me](https://namitamalik.github.io/)",
